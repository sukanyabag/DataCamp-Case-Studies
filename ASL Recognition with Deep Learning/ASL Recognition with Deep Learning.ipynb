American Sign Language (ASL)\n<p>American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals.

However, as a first step, towards understanding how to build a translation system, we can reduce the size of the problem by translating individual letters, instead of sentences.</p>\n<p><strong>In this notebook</strong>, we will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters.
